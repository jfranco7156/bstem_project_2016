            When was the last time you asked your neighbor if they needed help? Did you even know that someone only ten minutes
            away from you has trouble going to the store? <p class="vic">Vicinia</p> let's you help your neighbors. While you're bringing
            you neighbor their things why don't you talk to them a little? Meet new people, do a good thing, while at the same time making money
            for yourself. Anyone from a college student to a retired police officer can help make the community a better place.

            <p class="subtitle">Support Local Businesses!</p><br/>
            Here at <p class="vic">Vicinia</p> we are proud to have partnerships with your local businesses! Unlike a regular delivery 
            system, <p class="vic">Vicinia</p> gives you the option to shop from your favorite local shops. If you don't see a store from
            your neighborhood on our site contact us or the store owners and tell them they should partner with us! Big retailers are not the 
            only ones who deserve to have their products easily accessible.

            <p class="subtitle">Choose Your Deliverer!</p><br/>
            You have the power to choose everything on <p class="vic">Vicinia</p>. From the date, time, and place to which your goods should be delivered
            to the person who actually delivers them! Never be worried about who will appear at your doorstep because you will know exactly what they
            look like. <p class="vic">Vicinia</p> also offers a rating system so you can rate your deliverer (based on aspects such as friendliness, punctuality,
            and care) and also see what others have to say about them!

            <p class="subtitle">The Uber of Delivery Systems</p><br/>
            Having your neighbors deliver your goods for financial benefit makes <p class="vic">Vicinia</p> an Uber-like system for all 
            of your delivery needs. So what does this mean? This means that the cost for each delivery will be lower for you than from an employee-driven
            delivery system. Along with a more personalized delivery system you can support your local businesses. It's all about the neighborhood and community.
            Who can beat that?
