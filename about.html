            <p class="subtitle">Our Vision</p><br/>
            <p class="vic">Vicinia</p> believes in strengthening relationships within local communities by allowing neighbors to help 
            each other with groceries and general in-store purchases. When one finds oneself injured, sick, or simply 
            busy with day-to-day life, a neighbor is willing to help, for a little cash of course. <p class="vic">Vicinia</p> brings an 
            Uber-like service to the realm of online shopping.

        <div class="info">
            <p class="subtitle">Who is this for?</p><br/>
        	<p class="vic">Vicinia</p> relies on cooperation from the entire neighborhood, so not only can anyone use it, but it's imperative that everyone does.
        	<p class="vic">Vicinia</p> is especially vital to those who cannot easily leave the house, whether it be the disabled, elderly, or busy professionals. Anyone can benefit 
        	from having goods delivered to their doorstep by a friendly neighbor. Not being able to leave your house doesn't mean that you can't access your local stores
        	because <p class="vic">Vicinia</p> has partnered with hundreds of small businesses to help strengthen the local community.

            <p class="subtitle">Make some extra cash!</p><br/>
            If you're headed to the grocery store why not pick up some extra things so that Mrs. Delgado can bake cookies for her grandchildren? Just make sure you handle
            her ingrediants with love and care, the way you would with your own groceries, and you'll even make some money out of it! <p class="vic">Vicinia</p> wants to support
            everyone in the community, including those that are looking for a job. Work on your own time without a boss and you are gauranteed at least minimum wage 
            for every successful package delivered.

            For they are good! Meet the people that you never see from your community when they deliver you grocieries, toiletries, office supplies, 
            and more. This is the underlying cause for our services, because we believe that people are good and that you do not needed
            to be a professional to deliver the simple things. Should anything go wrong, however, <p class="vic">Vicinia</p> offers a report
            button so that you can report your deliverer. We take safety very seriously which is why this system, along with the customer ratings system, is offered. </div>
